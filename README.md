# WARNING - IN DEVELOPMENT, DO NOT USE

# AxonOpsâ„¢ Server Docker Compose
AxonOps is a comprehensive management platform designed for Apache Cassandra and Apache Kafka, offering unified monitoring, maintenance, and backup functionalities. Built by Cassandra and Kafka experts, it provides the only cloud-native solution to monitor, maintain and backup Apache Cassandra or Apache Kafka clusters through either SaaS or self-hosted deployments.

## Container Runtime Options
This project can be run using either Docker or [Podman](https://podman.io).

While Docker is the most widely used container runtime and perfectly suitable for running AxonOps, Podman offers some compelling features like its Apache Licence, daemonless architecture and enhanced security through rootless execution by default. Choose the runtime that best suits your needs and environment.

### Memory Management with Podman on macOS

When running memory-intensive containers like Elasticsearch or Cassandra using Podman on macOS, you may encounter Java heap space errors or memory allocation failures.

This occurs because Podman on macOS runs containers inside a Linux virtual machine (called a "machine") with default memory limits that may be insufficient for your workload. If you see errors containing "insufficient memory" or "failed to map" memory segments, increase your Podman machine's memory allocation using:

```bash
podman machine stop && podman machine set --memory 16384 && podman machine start
```

The memory value should exceed the combined heap sizes of your containers plus overhead - for example, when running Elasticsearch with 8GB heap, allocate at least 16GB to the Podman machine. For more details about Podman machine management and configuration, refer to the official documentation at https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-machine.1.html.

## Instructions

### Using Docker
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/axonops/axonops-server-compose
cd axonops-server-compose

# Start services
docker compose up -d
```

### Using Podman
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/axonops/axonops-server-compose
cd axonops-server-compose

# Start services
podman compose up -d
```

## Useful Commands
Commands work the same way for both Docker and Podman - just replace `podman` with `docker` as needed.

**Container Management**
```bash
# List containers
podman ps -a

# Stop all containers
podman compose down

# View container logs
podman logs <container_name>

# Container stats
podman stats

# Pull latest images
podman compose pull

# Restart services
podman compose restart
```

**Resource Management**
```bash
# View disk usage
podman system df

# Clean up unused resources
podman system prune

# View system information
podman system info
```

## Accessing AxonOps

Once the services are running, access the AxonOps dashboard at: http://localhost:3000

For production deployments, ensure proper security configurations are in place and refer to the official documentation for advanced setup options.

The platform provides dynamic dashboards for collecting logs and metrics, offering insights into cluster performance and health status. You can set up alerts for various metrics to ensure optimal performance.
